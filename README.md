# Zephyr-Chain
Zephyr Chain is a next-generation, highly scalable, and user-friendly blockchain designed for mass adoption. Our mission is to achieve 1 million transactions per second (TPS) to power global-scale decentralized applications.


The Problem
Existing blockchain networks face severe scalability limitations, resulting in low throughput, high fees, and slow confirmation times. This bottleneck prevents blockchain from supporting real-world, high-volume applications and achieving mainstream adoption.

The Solution: Zephyr's Core Innovations
Zephyr Chain addresses these challenges through a novel architecture combining:

Lightweight Client Nodes (Wallet Apps): Empowering any user to participate in the network with full control from their mobile or desktop device, without the heavy burden of running a full node.

Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS): A highly efficient, democratic, and environmentally friendly consensus mechanism.

Sharding: Horizontal partitioning of the blockchain for massive parallel transaction processing.

Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Exploration: Researching non-linear data structures for potential further throughput enhancements.

Technology Stack
Core Blockchain (Go): The consensus engine and node logic are built in Go for its performance, concurrency, and robustness. We are leveraging a modified version of Tendermint Core for its battle-tested BFT consensus engine.

Smart Contracts (Solidity): To ensure a low barrier to entry for developers, we will support Solidity and aim for EVM compatibility, allowing for easy migration of existing dApps.

Light Node Wallet (Vue.js): The reference wallet application is being built with Vue.js 3, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for a modern, reactive, and fast user experience.

Cryptography: We use industry-standard libraries in both Go and JavaScript for hashing (SHA256) and digital signatures (ECDSA).

Roadmap

Phase 1: MVP focusing on validating core assumptions
- Basic Light Node UI for account management.

- Integrating client-side transaction signing and broadcasting.

- Implementing the core DPoS logic and validator election mechanism in our Go backend.

-  Scaling our network simulator to test for bottlenecks and performance.


Phase 2: Sharding Implementation: Design and implement the sharding architecture and cross-shard communication protocols.

Phase 3: DAG Integration (Exploratory): Research and prototype DAG structures to enhance transaction ordering and finality.

Phase 4: Network Expansion & Ecosystem: Launch public testnet, onboard validators, and build out developer tooling (SDKs, documentation) to foster a vibrant ecosystem.
